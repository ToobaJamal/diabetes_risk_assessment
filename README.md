- HTML and CSS for structure and styling
- JavaScript to get health related news from an API and display them at home page
- Python Scikit-learn to train Machine Learning model on [Diabetes Risk Prediction Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.) Flask to deploy the model

## Optimizations
When I improve this project, I will work making the UI better. A cleaner UI will make this project even better.
