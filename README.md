# [Diabetes Risk Assessment](https://github.com/ToobaJamal/diabetes_risk_assessment)
The concept was to create an app where users can answer a few health related questions and get their diabetes risk predicted based on the answers they provide. The web app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend and Python for backend. The purpose of using these languages is; 
- HTML and CSS for structure and styling
- JavaScript to get health related news from an API and display them at home page
- Python Scikit-learn to train Machine Learning model on [Diabetes Risk Prediction Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.) Flask to deploy the model
